Because initial testing of the bonebed indicated that it was more than a meter wide in some places, each meter segment of length was divided into a northeast square meter ‘A’ and a southwest square meter ‘B’.\r\nProbing of fill at the east end of the pad revealed the original east edge of the hill, as indicated by buried rooted vegetation. Systematic excavation of the bonebed began at that end and proceeded westward. The original plan was fashioned in the manner of excavations typical of fairly flat-lying strata. The 6” (15.2 cm) depth would be excavated in three 2” (5.1 cm) deep intervals. Many of the larger bones penetrated all three artificial intervals because of the dip of the strata, and that approach soon was found to be infeasible. The more natural approach was to work through bedding planes, and thus excavation of a square meter was executed from north to south or vice-versa. Positions of identifiable fossils were mapped, one meter square per page. Orientations of long bones and flat bones were determined with a Brunton compass and recorded. Well- defined stratigraphic contacts, presence or absence of clay pebbles, and presence of caliche and opal were also recorded.\r\nDigital photographs were taken of important features and of excavated and swept quarry floors. Each identifiable fossil was assigned a number and placed in an appropriate container (plastic film canister, ziplock bag, etc.) with that number (Figure 3). Cyanoacrilate was the primary preservative used during the excavation. White glue was employed for hardening of some large and porous blocks of sediment. When dense\r\naccumulations of bones were encountered, they were removed in plaster jackets and later dismantled elsewhere in order to minimize the time spent on the pad. A gasoline- powered electric generator was employed to power a diamond saw and an air compressor and pneumatic jackhammer when necessary. The sediments excavated from each square were saved in plastic containers. Each container bore the number of the square, and these were set aside for future screening and picking.""",,"T. S.

On October 30, 1992 toward the end of a very productive season, we took relatively large bulk samples from an area in which Levels 23 and 26 B both seemed unusually fossiliferous. The field number for the sample from Level 23 is FS 106 C. It weighed 3.04 kg after it was washed through 1/4 in. screen and dried. For Level 26 B the field number was FS 92.129 A and the bulk sample weighed 3.44 kg. In each case less than 10% of the bulk sample (fine sand and clay) washed through the screen.
